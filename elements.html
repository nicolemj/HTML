        Just <strong>go back and put one</strong> little more happy tree in there.
        Let's put a touch more of the magic here. 
        Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind.
        Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world.
        It looks so good, I might as well not stop. </p>
    <p> 
        This painting comes right out of your heart. 
        Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Anyone can paint.
        I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, 
        and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. 
        Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.  
    </p>

    <p> 
        All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.
        In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. 
        You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. 
        You're so very special.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. 
        Having a good day. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and 
        have fun. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Let's get crazy. 
        You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.
    
    </p>
